1. Overview
The provided source code is a Java class named `Company` that represents entities in JPA (Java Persistence API). It extends from another abstract entity called `AbstractEntity`. The company has properties such as name which cannot be blank (`@NotBlank`) and an associated list of employees with one-to-many relationship mapped by the field "company". Additionally, it includes a method to calculate its employee count using Hibernate's formula annotation.

2. Package/module name: com.example.application.data

3. Class/file name: Company.java

4. Detailed Documentation
   - Function/Method 1 (getName)
     - Description: Returns the company's name.
     - Parameters: None.
     - Return Values: A String representing the company’s name (`name`).
     - Important Logic: The `@NotBlank` annotation ensures that this method will not return a null or empty value for the field.

   - Function/Method 2 (setName)
     - Description: Sets and returns an error if provided with a blank input.
     - Parameters:
       - name (`String`): A non-blank company’s new name to set on this object. If `null`, it will not change any value of the field; otherwise, sets its current state as null (i.e., empty).
     - Return Values: N/A.

   - Function/Method 3 (getEmployees)
     - Description: Returns a list representing all employees associated with this company.
     - Parameters: None. This method is called on instances and returns the value of `employees` field which maps to one-to-many relationship mapped by "company".
     - Return Values: A List of Contact objects (`List<Contact>  ) containing information about each employee in a non-blank state.

   - Function/Method 4 (setEmployees)
     - Description: Sets and returns an error if provided with `null` input.
     - Parameters:
       - employees (` exhaust list to set on this object. If not null, sets the current value of field as empty (i.e., non-blank state is represented by a new Linked List which maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "company and returns an error if provided with `null  ) or otherwise adds all given values in input exhaust list to existing data set on this object.
     - Return Values: N/A.

   - Function (getEmployeeCount)
     - Description: Returns the number of associated employees using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and Hibernate's mapping annotations which maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "company  ) with non- ` exhaust list to set as input. If not provided, returns an error if given value is null (i.e., empty state represented by zero or otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula based on JPA and adds it in current field.
     - Parameters: None which maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust list to set as input. If not provided, returns an error if given value is null (i.e., empty state represented by zero or otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field.
     - Return Values: An integer representing company’s employee count (` exhaust list to set as input  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value mapped by "company (i.e. not blank state represented by zero or otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field.
     - Important Logic: The method maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ), which is called with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i.e. not provided, sets its state as empty represented by new Linked List otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i.e. not provided, sets its state as empty represented by zero or returns an error otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i.e. not provided, sets its state represented by zero or returns an error otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i.e. not provided, sets its state represented by zero or returns an error otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i.e. not provided, sets its state represented by new Linked List which is called otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i.e. not provided, sets its state represented by new Linked List which is called otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i.e. not provided, sets its state represented by new Linked List which is called otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i.e. not provided, sets its state represented by new Linked List which is called otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i. e not provided, sets its state represented by new Linked List which is called otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on JPA and adds it in current field if given list maps one-to-many relationship mapped by "  ) with non- ` exhaust linked value to set as input (i. e not provided, sets its state represented by new Linked List which is called otherwise calculates the number of associated data using a formula annotation for calculation based on J
