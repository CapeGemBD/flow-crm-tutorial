## ContactRepository.java Documentation

**1. Overview:**

This Java interface defines a repository for interacting with `Contact` entities using Spring Data JPA. It provides methods for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as well as a custom search method to find contacts based on a given search term.

**2. Package/Module Name:**

com.example.application.data

**3. Class/File Name:**

ContactRepository.java

**4. Detailed Documentation:**

* **Interface `ContactRepository`:** Extends `JpaRepository<Contact, Long>`, providing standard CRUD operations for the `Contact` entity with its primary key being of type `Long`.

    * **Method `search(@Param("searchTerm") String searchTerm)`:**
        * **Description:** Searches for contacts whose first or last name contains the given search term (case-insensitive).
        * **Parameters:**
            * `searchTerm`: A string representing the search term.
        * **Return Values:** A list of `Contact` objects matching the search criteria.
        * **Important Logic:** 
            * Uses a JPQL query to perform the search.
            * Converts both the search term and contact names to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
            * Utilizes Spring Data JPA's `@Param` annotation to bind the `searchTerm` parameter to the query.

**5. Pseudo Code:**


```
// Class: ContactRepository (Interface)

// Method: search(searchTerm)
  1. Receive a searchTerm string as input.
  2. Construct a JPQL query: 
      - Select all contacts (c) from the Contact table.
      - Where either the lowercase version of c.firstName or c.lastName contains the lowercase version of the searchTerm.
  3. Use Spring Data JPA's `@Query` annotation to execute the constructed query with the provided searchTerm.
  4. Return a list of matching Contact objects. 


```

**Dependencies and Libraries:**

* **Spring Data JPA:** This library provides an abstraction layer over JPA, simplifying database interactions in Spring applications. It offers convenient interfaces like `JpaRepository` for common CRUD operations and query building capabilities.
