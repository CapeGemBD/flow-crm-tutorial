1. Overview
The provided source code defines a Java class named `AbstractEntity` that serves as a base entity for other entities in JPA (Java Persistence API). It includes common fields such as ID generation strategy using sequences and versioning to handle optimistic locking.

2. Package/module name: com.example.application.data

3. Class/file name: AbstractEntity.java

4. Detailed Documentation
   - Function/Method 1
     - Description: Represents an abstract base class for JPA entities with common fields like id, generated value strategy using sequences and versioning.
     - Parameters: None (this is a static utility/class).
     - Return Values: N/A (no methods are defined in this class; it's used as a superclass by other classes to inherit its properties).

   - Function/Method 2
     - Description: Getter for the id field of an entity instance. This method returns the unique identifier assigned to each entity.
     - Parameters: None (it is called on instances).
     - Return Values: A Long representing the ID value.

   - Function/Method 3
     - Description: Setter for the id field of an entity instance, allowing setting a new ID if necessary. This method can be used when replacing or updating entities.
     - Parameters:
       - `id`: The unique identifier to set on this object (Long).
     - Return Values: N/A.

   - Function/Method 4
     - Description: Getter for the version field of an entity instance, which is typically incremented with each update operation as part of optimistic locking.
     - Parameters: None (it is called on instances).
     - Return Values: An int representing the current value of the versioning.

   - Function/Method 5
     - Description: Setter for the version field to manually set or reset it. This method can be used when replacing entities with a new state.
     - Parameters:
       - `version`: The initial version number (int).
     - Return Values: N/A.

   - Important Logic:
     - The class uses JPA annotations like @Id, @GeneratedValue, and @Version to define the entity's primary key generation strategy using sequences (`id` field) for unique identification.
     - It also includes a `hashCode()` method that generates an ID-based hash code if available; otherwise, it falls back on its superclass implementation. This is important in JPA entities as it's used by Hibernate and other libraries to uniquely identify the entity instances.

5. Pseudo Code
    - The class itself does not have methods but provides a structure for derived classes.
  ```
// Class: AbstractEntity

// Method: abstractMethod1 (No parameters, No return values)
  1. Define @MappedSuperclass annotation indicating this is an abstraction base for other entities in JPA.

  2. Declare the id field with:
     - Use of `@Id` to indicate it as a primary key.
     - Set up sequence generation using `strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "idgenerator" and provide initial value (Long).
  
  3. Mark @SequenceGenerator for consistent ID values across entity instances.

  4. Define the version field with:
     - Use of `@Version` to handle optimistic locking by incrementing on each update.
  ```

5. Pseudo Code
    Since this is an abstract class, there are no specific methods or logic that need pseudocode representation as it serves a different purpose from other classes in JPA entities.

```
// Class: AbstractEntity (No instance operations)

// Method/Function 1 to N - No actual method calls since the class provides fields for derived entity instances.
  1. The abstract base is used by deriving common properties like id and version through its defined methods on specific subclasses of this abstraction in JPA entities.

  2. Pseudo code representation not required as it serves a different purpose from other classes with actual method calls or logic operations but provides structure for derived entity instances.
